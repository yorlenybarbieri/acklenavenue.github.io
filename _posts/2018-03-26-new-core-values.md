Core values define us. They describe who we are and why we do what we do. They are more than just words. They influence our decisions and lead us to where we want to go. At Acklen Avenue a few years ago, went through an arduous process of selecting our core values. We have ridden the wave of that process ever since. However, while trying to embody our core values, we discovered that some things were missing. We realized over time that our previously chosen core values, though they seemed great at the time, actually don’t describe us to a tea. That’s when we knew it was time for a change. 

 Our previous core values were:  
 - We rigorously pursue fun.  
 - We empower our teammates. 
 - We own our client’s success. 
 - We demand elegant solutions. 
 - We create community.

These core values empowered us to a great length, but we have learned there is so much more to accomplish. We could be more. In some ways, we already are more. 

We have grown by leaps and bounds in the last few months. Not only has our team more than doubled in size, but we have also taken on new challenges and initiatives. Dedicated to constant improvement, our former identity is but a shadow of who we are now. There was nothing wrong with our old core values, but we needed a set of values that go deeper then fun, empowerment, success, elegance and community.

So, we hunkered down and turned our x-ray vision on ourselves. What’s really at the heart of Acklen Avenue? Here’s what we came up with:

**Integrity** 

We will do the right thing, even if it hurts, by not participating or supporting dishonesty, corruption, or unfairness to any people group. We will do what’s best for our clients, even if it means losing money or saying goodbye. We will be honest in everything we do.

**Mastery**

We will be better than we were yesterday by finding ways to improve each day and welcoming better ways to do things. We will empower our teammates to do better, facilitating learning for those inside and outside our organization. We will welcome feedback from all angles and always demand elegant solutions.

**Quality**

We will create high-quality products, inside and out by taking ownership of our client's success.
We will spend the time it takes to do a great job in order to help our clients get what they really need, not just what they said they needed 6 months ago. We will deliver a product that makes our client happy and be worthy of repeat business.

**Agility**

We will deliver valuable, flexible and maintainable products as often as possible by partnering with our clients in order to maximize learning and product value by using an Agile Approach to software development. We will allow down to speed up.

**Love**

We will care for our fellow ackleners, both professionally and personally at the same time we care for our clients and their success.

The essence of our old core values resides in each of our new ones, a reminder of how much we have grown and how much more growth remains.
